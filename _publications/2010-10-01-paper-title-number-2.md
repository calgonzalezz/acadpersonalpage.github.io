Abstract: We analyze the impact of National Regulatory Agencies (NRAs) governance on achieving environmental objectives. On the one hand, during the liberalization reforms, European governments delegated regulatory powers to NRAs to maintain fair competition in the electric market, provide investment incentives, reduce consumer bills, and increase the efficiency of electric networks. On the other hand, decarbonization has acquired widespread political support in recent years. In the last ten years, we have observed an increase in the share of renewable energy in most European countries, which creates tensions with some of the liberalization’s objectives. We hypothesize that independent NRAs align with the liberalization mandates at the expense of reducing the adoption pace of renewable energies. We use a panel data analysis to assess the influence of NRAs governance on renewable-energy shares in 24 EU countries for the period 2013-2018. We uncover a negative, significant and robust relationship between NRA independence – which measures the distance between the NRA and the government – and the share of renewable energy generation from total energy consumption. Our results contribute to the study of the impact of regulatory governance regimes on environmental objectives.
