Abstract: This article explores the application of Natural Language Processing algorithms to summarise survey information from the OECD Product Market Regulation and Regulatory Inquiry Questionnaire. Our method extracts key regulatory characteristics from the the surveys’ text representations and describes regulatory regimes using three dimensions, state ownership, network access and product characteristi control. This description departs from traditional view by distinguishing the the provisions that support new incumbents access to the natural monopoly segments of the industry from the incumbent’s power to set product/service standards. Moreover, our scores highlight significant correlations between our dimensions and industry outcomes.
