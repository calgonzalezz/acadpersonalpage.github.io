I am an economist interested in topics related to economic regulation, regulatory management, governance of regulatory agencies and policy evaluation. I am also interested in text analysis algorithm application and causal inference.

I hold a PhD in Management under the supervision of professor Eric Brousseau at Paris Dauphine University - PSL.

I have professional experience in policy analysis in international affairs, trade and energy.
